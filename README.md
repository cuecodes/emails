# emails
Typescript email library for your project.


This library makes integrating emails in your project blazing fast and without headaches.

The integration is with Brevo which gives you 300 emails a day as of today, a free alternative to Mailgun.
We will also see how to set up your email integration with just your domain name, no need for email hosting.
I will do this in a blog post.


## Getting started

Install the package
`npm i @cuecodes/emails`
